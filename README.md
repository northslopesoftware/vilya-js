# vilya

## Description

Vilya is an abstraction layer for network messages, which handles the connection, control messages, and messages serialization. Currently, vilya supports WebSockets and Ajv serialization.

## Why vilya?

Nerd stuff. Vilya is one of the elven rings of power from J.R.R. Tolkien literature. Vilya is the ring of air that was owned by Elrond, which apparently helped Elrond conceal Rivendell. Vilya conceals over-the-air messages behind through abstraction and encapsulation.
